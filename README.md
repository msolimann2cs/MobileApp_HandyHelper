# On-Demand Service Mobile Application

## Overview

Collaborated with a team of three colleagues to design and develop an on-demand service mobile application using Java. The application provides a platform for users to become either service providers or consumers. Consumers can post service requests, while service providers can accept and fulfill those requests.

## Key Features

- **User Roles:** Implemented dual user roles (Service Provider and Consumer) accessible after login, enabling users to fulfill or request services.

- **Service Requests:** Consumers can browse and select from a list of service requests made by other users, while service providers can accept and fulfill those requests.

- **User Profiles:** Developed a user profile section containing settings, request history, wallet balance, and other personalized features.

- **Backend Infrastructure:** Created a Node.js API backend to handle user authentication, service requests, and user interactions. Utilized MySQL database to store user data and service requests.

- **Design Collaboration:** Utilized Figma for collaborative design, ensuring a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.

- **Iterative Development:** Employed an iterative development approach to continuously enhance the project. Started with defined requirements and iteratively improved design, functionality, and code quality.

## Technologies Used

- **Front-end:** Java for the mobile application's user interface.
- **Back-end:** Node.js for the API backend.
- **Database:** MySQL for storing user and request data.
- **Design:** Figma for collaborative design and UI/UX improvement.


## Achievements

- Collaborated in a team of four to design, develop, and deploy a fully functional on-demand service mobile application.
- Successfully implemented user authentication, request posting, acceptance, and fulfillment workflows.
- Achieved seamless communication between the Java front-end and Node.js backend using custom API endpoints.

## Future Development

- Continuously refining the user experience through feedback and usage metrics.
- Enhancing security measures, including encryption for sensitive user data.
- Scaling the application to accommodate a larger user base while maintaining performance.
